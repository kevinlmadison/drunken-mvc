# Drunken MVC (Model View Controller)
## Introduction
Drunken MVC is a model view controller coded mostly in PHP. It was designed 
with the bare minimum in mind; only what does an MVC -need-, with a few
exceptions. 

By default, the MySQLi database class by Josh Campbell is loaded. 
[MYSQL](http://github.com/joshcam/PHP-MySQLi-Database-Class ).
